# Video Paradise

Video Paradise is a simple CRUD application for managing your home movie database.<br>
That is, if you are a neanderthal and still have movies on physical media.<br>
Offers basic functionalities (besides creating/retrieving/updating and deleting) like filtering and simple text search.<br>
Creating cool logo was the biggest part of the development, so I hope you'll enjoy it.<br>
The logo, I mean.
